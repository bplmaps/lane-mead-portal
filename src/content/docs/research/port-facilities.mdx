Periodically, the Corps' Water Resources Support Center has compiled useful information about the facilities available to commercial shipping interests in the major ports, Boston being Port Series No. 3.  Included are detailed maps and descriptions of cargo facilities, dry docking, marine repair, shipbuilding, energy facilities, warehouses, and rail lines into the port.  The BPL's holdings of Port Series No. 3 include volumes from 1922 to 1994. Much of the information that used to be printed is now available online at the Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center.
