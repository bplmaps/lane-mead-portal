We have many collections that detail Boston’s early maritime history, however the material related to the time frame of the Lane/Mead Collection, mid-19th to late 20th century, is rather spotty.

The Massachusetts Historical Commission (MHC) has conducted studies of Boston’s industrial past and Boston’s waterfront history which are helpful in charting the Port’s maritime industrial history during the relevant time.  Searches of BPL holdings are linked with the properties studied by the MHC, if available at the BPL. 

We hold hundreds of documents prepared by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA).  As the City’s planning agency from the mid-20th century, it has had significant impact on the development of the Port of Boston through its waterfront planning and development decisions.  Many of the BRA’s studies include a history of the area under consideration.  A few of the reports are included in this section but researchers may find additional searches for BRA waterfront development projects by neighborhood to be useful.
