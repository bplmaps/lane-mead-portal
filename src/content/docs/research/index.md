The Lane/Mead Boston Maritime Collection at the Boston Public Library documents aspects of Boston’s maritime industrial history primarily from the mid-19th century to the end of the 20th century.

As a steamship agent, Mr. Lane’s job was to bring cargos into port, requiring an interest in port facilities, harbor maintenance, labor relations, marine safety, regulations, and other less romantic aspects of port operations. Searches were conducted for documentation of these operational aspects of the port and for historical maritime businesses on the Boston waterfront.

More information on the contents of this collection can be found at archives.bpl.org, and the collection itself can be requested to use in the Special Collections Reading Room.
