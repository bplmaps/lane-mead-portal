The Coast Guard,  now a division of the U. S. Department of Homeland Security, provides essential services to the maritime industry including:

    Search and Rescue 
    Placement and maintenance of Aids to Navigation
    Port, Waterway and Coastal Security
    Cybersecurity

among other missions.

Boston is the headquarters of U.S. Coast Guard District 1 .

We have numerous documents about and authored by the Coast Guard but few that pertain directly to Boston or District 1.  Writers are fascinated with the Coast Guardâ€™s dramatic rescues at sea and there are a number of books to be found on that topic, as well as many general histories of the service.
